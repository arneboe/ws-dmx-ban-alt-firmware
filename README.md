# Alternative Firmware for WS-DMX-xCH BAN LED Controllers

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arneboe/ws-dmx-ban-alt-firmware/main/programmer_pinout.jpg?v=2&s=10)



# Features
This firmware adds some features that the original firmware is missing.

* 400hz led refresh rate
* Master control channel to scale the brightness of all leds
* Strobe channel (2hz to 40hz) with a flash length of 10ms
* Individual control of each led
* Set dmx adress using dip switch
* Flicker power led to indicate correct dmx signal reception.

## Planned Features
* Implement a random strobe
* Different dimming curves
* Maybe implement some static effects
* increase code readability without decreasing performance
* increase performance of the main loop

# Supported controllers
**Currently only working on the WS-DMX-8CH BAN V4.1!**

Support for other revisions might follow as soon as I get my hands on them.


# DMX Channels

|Ch | Function|
|---|---------|
|1 | Master intensity |
|2 | Strobe 2hz to 40hz |
|3 | Led 1 intensity | 
|4 | Led 2 intensity | 
|5 | Led 3 intensity | 
|6 | Led 4 intensity | 
|7 | Led 5 intensity | 
|8 | Led 6 intensity | 
|9 | Led 7 intensity | 
|10 | Led 8 intensity | 




# State of the Code
The code is a bit messy, lots of external variables are used.
Some code has been unrolled to increase performance.
Some code is in locations that it logically shouldn't be in for performance reasons.


# Compiling and Flashing
## Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install sdcc
pip3 install stcgal
```
## Compiling
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../sdcc.toolchain ..
```

## Flashing
The STC15W404s can be programmed using a standard usb-serial adapter.
I am using FTDI FT232 but any other adapter should work as well.

1. Set the FT232 to 3.3V
2. Connect RX/TX/GND from FT232 adapter according to the pinout image. Do not connect VCC!
3. Connect external power supply to the board
4. start the flasing process using the command below
5. turn on the board

- DMX needs to be disconnected for flashing to work.
- Flasher TX needs to be disconnected for dmx to work.
- Flasher RX/GND can stay connected while dmx is received. This is nice for debugging.


```bash
stcgal -P stc15 -p /dev/ttyUSB0  dmx.ihx
```
